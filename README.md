### DJS06 Project Brief: Higher Order Functions

#### Submission Guidelines:

#### Explanation of Logic:
Each exercise uses a specific array method (forEach, map, filter, reduce) to manipulate and transform the data.
For example, map is used to create new arrays (uppercase transformation, name lengths), filter is used to exclude certain elements (provinces containing "Cape", products without valid prices), and reduce is used to aggregate data (object mapping, total price).

#### Combining Methods:
For complex operations, multiple methods are combined, such as filtering and then mapping in the price manipulation exercise.
This ensures the operations remain declarative and concise, highlighting the power of higher-order functions.

#### Code Readability:
The code is structured and commented to make each step clear and maintainable.
Readability and efficiency are prioritized, with careful handling of data types and potential edge cases (e.g., non-numeric prices).
